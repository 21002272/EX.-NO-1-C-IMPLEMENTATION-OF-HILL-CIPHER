# EX.-NO-1-C-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-HILL-CIPHER

## AIM:
To write a C program to implement the hill cipher substitution techniques.

## ALGORITHM:

STEP-1: Read the plain text and key from the user.

STEP-2: Split the plain text into groups of length three.

STEP-3: Arrange the keyword in a 3*3 matrix.

STEP-4: Multiply the two matrices to obtain the cipher text of length three.

STEP-5: Combine all these groups to get the complete cipher text.

## PROGRAM: 

## OUTPUT:

## RESULT:
  Thus the hill cipher substitution technique had been implemented successfully.
